# Contributing to Ably Flutter

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository
- Install [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- Install Android Studio, and then in Android Studio, install the [Flutter plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter).
  - Though you can debug Dart code from Visual Studio Code, you cannot debug the Android code.
- Download the dependencies listed in `pubspec.yaml` by running `flutter pub get`
  - Files have a yellow background in Android Studio's project [tool window](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro) because they are marked as a library. This is intended as per [this IntelliJ Flutter plugin issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/issues/5596), but may be confusing or potentially limiting. You can delete the `.packages` file every time `flutter pub get` is run. This is optional. It is a deprecated autogenerated file which confuses Android Studio into thinking all files are build outputs instead of source files. 
- Run `flutter doctor` to confirm your environment is setup correctly.

## Editing and writing platform (Android/iOS) code

- You can edit both example app and package code in the same IDE (Xcode, Android Studio or AppCode) window.
- **Android:** You can edit Android code by opening the example app with another Android Studio window. This example project shows all gradle modules in the repository, including the example app, the Ably Flutter package, but also all other packages installed in your `pubspec.yaml` which provide gradle modules.
- **iOS:** You can edit iOS code by opening the example app with [AppCode](https://www.jetbrains.com/objc/) or [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). The example project has access to the main plugin iOS code via symlinks.
  - Recommended usage of Xcode and AppCode:
    - Xcode: For modifying configuration (e.g. signing and capabilities, `Info.plist`) or other features not supported by AppCode
    - AppCode: For writing code, refactoring or debugging.

## Runing and debugging (Android/iOS) code

- You cannot run packages independently, so Flutter package plugins include an example app to use the package.
- **Android:** In the Flutter project window, launch the application in debug mode in Android Studio. Then, in the Android project window, attach the debugger to the Android process. You can also do this with IntelliJ Idea.
- **iOS:** Both AppCode and Xcode can build and debug your flutter application. To use breakpoints, set them in AppCode or Xcode, but not Android Studio. **Warning:** `flutter run` will automatically run `pod install` in the `example/ios` folder, but if you don't use `flutter run` and use Xcode or AppCode, you may face Cocoapods errors if any dependencies are added or removed, and will need to run `pod install`. 

## Making changes

We use Github actions to check code is formatted correctly. You should format your code using the same style to avoid Github CI job failures, since we do not automatically commit and format code.
- To format files, run `./format-files.sh`. It requires a few tools to be installed (e.g. `flutter`, `swiftformat` and `google-java-format`). Try to run `./format-files.sh` or read `format-files.sh` to discover and install the dependencies.
- To run this command successfully, you need to setup your environment. Read `format-files.sh` for more information.
- To automatically check formatting before committing, you can use the git hook shared in this repo. 
  - Run `git config core.hooksPath hooks`
  - Git hooks don't work well in SourceTree, as per [SourceTree : Hook failing because paths don't seem to be set correctly](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Bitbucket-questions/SourceTree-Hook-failing-because-paths-don-t-seem-to-be-set/qaq-p/274792). You will need to open SourceTree using `open /Applications/SourceTree.app/Contents/MacOS/SourceTree`.
## High level architecture

The code in this repository has been constructed to be
[built as a Flutter Plugin](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#plugin). 
It invokes methods in other Ably SDKs (Ably Android and Ably Cocoa) through `MethodChannels` and `EventChannels`. This means Android and iOS code provided in the plugin runs when the user's application is launched, even without them calling any methods in Ably directly.

## Implementation Notes

### Hot reload, hot restart and app restart

There are 3 types of "refreshes" you might see in a Flutter app:
- **[Hot reload](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/hot-reload):** Both Flutter and iOS apps are **not** restarted. The application state remains the same. Updated source files are injected into the running Dart VM.
- **Hot restart:** The Flutter application is restarted, but the host application (Android and iOS apps which host the Flutter application) does not.
  - State of the flutter application is reset. This means fields are all reset to their default values (or null).
  - This also means we must remember to clear the state in the host application when the app hot restarts. We do this by calling `await methodChannel.invokeMethod(PlatformMethod.resetAblyClients);`.
  - From Flutter documentation:
> With a hot restart, the program starts from the beginning, executes the new version of main(), and builds a widget tree that displays the text Hello.
- **App restart:** The entire application is restarted, clearing the state of both the Flutter application and the host application (Android and iOS apps).

### Exceptions and Errors

Dart libraries don't _extend_ the [Exception class](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.4.0/dart-core/Exception-class.html),
they _implement_ its implicit interface.
(see [this comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13579982/custom-exceptions-in-dart#comment18616624_13580222)).

For the moment it would not seem appropriate for our plugin to throw instances conforming to the implicit interface
of the [Error class](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.4.0/dart-core/Error-class.html), as this is perhaps more
appropriate for programmer's failures on the Dart side of things. But time will tell.

### Push Notifications 

#### Push Notifications activation and deactivation

The platform SDKs ([ably-android](https://github.com/ably/ably-java) and [ably-cocoa](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa)) enable users to check if device activation, deactivation, or registration update fails. On Android, these errors are sent in Intents which users should register for at runtime. In Cocoa, errors are returned through `ARTPushRegistererDelegate` methods. However, in both SDKs, this error does not always return quickly. For example, if there was no internet connection, then `Push.activate()` will not throw an error, it will just block forever, because errors are not provided by the SDKs. Once an internet connection is made, the Intent will be sent and delegate methods will be called.

Ably Flutter does this by passing a reference to the `FlutterResult` used to pass back the result to the Dart side, when the activation or deactivation completes. This makes it convenient for users: they can `await push.activate()`. However, users should not rely on this Future completing, in the case of network issues.

#### Notification tap handling

Android's Firebase Messaging library enables users to select the Intent action used when the automatically-generated notification is tapped by the user. Users can do this by setting `fcm.notification.click_action` in Ably's push payload. However, for this to work, users would need to declare the intent action within their `AndroidManifest.xml`. Therefore, we don't really tell users they can modify `click_action` and configure it. However, they can do so if they wish.

#### Notifications generation for Foreground Apps

iOS enables users to show the notification received remotely even if the app is in the foreground, by calling a delegate method ([`userNotificationCenter(_:willPresent:withCompletionHandler:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unusernotificationcenterdelegate/1649518-usernotificationcenter)) which the user can choose to show the message to the user, based on the notification content. FCM does not provide this functionality. Users can only configure this behaviour for iOS, by using `PushNotificationEvents#setOnShowNotificationInForeground`. 

#### Push Notifications Background Message Handling

Background processing in Flutter is a complicated subject that has not been explored publicly in detail. It involves creating Dart isolates manually (for Android), passing messages back and forth, etc.

Differences between Ably Flutter and Firebase Messaging implementation (Android only):
- **Isolate code:** Firebase Messaging explicitly defines a callback which is launched in a custom isolate. Ably Flutter does not launch a custom dart entrypoint, but instead re-uses the user's default entrypoint (their Flutter application), by using `DartExecutor.DartEntrypoint.createDefault()`. Therefore, Ably Flutter provides the same environment for message handling on both Android and iOS: users application **is running** when we handle the message.
- **Resource consumption tradeoffs:** Firebase launches an isolate capable of only handling messages at app launch, even if users' application isn't handling remote messages. Firebase Messaging keeps this isolate running throughout the app, and have a queue process to queue messages by maintaining an Android Service. This allows 10 minutes of execution time, where as on iOS, Firebase Messaging only has 30 seconds of execution time. Instead, Ably Flutter launches a new isolate on every message if the application is not yet running and avoids creating a service and queueing work. A new message will spawn a new engine.
- **Execution time:** Ably Flutter provides users with an execution time of 30 seconds on both Android and iOS to handle each message. On Android, Firebase messaging launches a Service which has [approximately 10 minutes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48630606/how-long-is-the-jobservice-execution-time-limit-mentioned-in-androids-jobinte) of execution time from it's launch to handle all messages received before Android stops the service. It's unclear if the Service will be automatically launched by iOS immediately, or if it will only be launched in the future. On iOS, each message has 30 seconds of execution time. This seems to be a bug in the design of firebase_messaging. Users can extend their execution time by using [package:workmanager](https://pub.dev/packages/workmanager).
  
Because of this architectural simplicity, Ably Flutter does not need to use [`PluginUtilities`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69208164/what-does-pluginutilities-do-in-flutters-dartui-library-and-how-do-i-use/69208165#69208165), pass references of two methods between Dart and host platform, or save and load these methods in `SharedPreferences`. Ably Flutter avoids conflicts between the default `FlutterEngine` launched with a `FlutterActivity` and the one manually launched in the `BroadcastReceiver`, by using method channels with unique channel names.

## Platform Notes

### Android

The Android project does use [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx), which appears to be the default specified when Flutter created the plugin project, however Flutter's Java API for plugins (e.g. [MethodChannel](https://api.flutter.dev/javadoc/io/flutter/plugin/common/MethodChannel.html)) appears to still use deprecated platform APIs like the [UiThread](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/annotation/UiThread) annotation.

### iOS

Once changes have been made to the platform code in the [ios folder](ios), especially if those changes involve changing
[the pod spec](ios/ably_flutter.podspec) to add a dependency, then it may be necessary to force that build up stream with:

1. Bump `s.version` in the pod spec
2. From [example/ios](example/ios) run `pod install`
3. Open [Runner.xcworkspace](example/ios/Runner.xcworkspace) in Xcode, clean and build

Otherwise, after making simple code changes to the platform code it will not get seen with a hot restart "R".
Therefore if there's a current emulation running then use "q" to quit it and then re-run the emulator - e.g. with this if you've
got both iOS and Android emulators open:

    flutter run -d all

## Testing changes in dependencies

After making changes to `ably-java` or `ably-cocoa`, you can test changes without releasing those dependencies to users. To do this, you need a local copy of the repo with the changes you want to test.

To test `ably-cocoa` changes, in `Podfile`, below `target 'Runner' do`, add:

```ruby
    pod 'Ably', :path => 'local/path/to/ably-cocoa'
```

To test `ably-java` changes, see [Using ably-java / ably-android locally in other projects](https://github.com/ably/ably-java/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#using-ably-java--ably-android-locally-in-other-projects).

## Writing documentation

As features are developed, ensure documentation (both in the public API interface) and in relevant markdown files are updated. When referencing images in markdown files, using a local path such as `images/android.png`, for example `![An android device running on API level 30](images/android.png)` will result in the image missing on pub.dev README preview. Therefore, we currently reference images through the github.com URL path (`https://github.com/ably/ably-flutter/raw/`), for example to reference `images/android.png`, we would use `![An android device running on API level 30](https://github.com/ably/ably-flutter/raw/main/images/android.png)`. [A suggestion](https://github.com/dart-lang/pub-dev/issues/5068) has been made to automatically replace this relative image path to the github URL path.

## Serialization

Data is JSON-serialized back and forth from Dart to Android/iOS, where a dictionary/hashmap containing string constants as key (e.g. "name"), and the data as the value. Files containing constants (strings, integers) shared across Dart, Android and iOS are generated from the contents of `codegen_context.dart`. The output of this code generation is `platform_constants.dart`, 

You'll notice 3 categories of constants:
- CodecTypes: These constants help identify which type has just been received from the Dart or platform so that we can deserialize it.
- PlatformMethod: Method invocations called from Dart to platform side, or vice-versa.
- JSON-serialization property names. These are strings used to identify values between Dart and platform.
  - For the case of enums: e.g. an enum from Java is converted to a String and converted back into the correct enum, based on the string value.
  - To send dictionaries/maps containing data, we need to identify each one. For example, to send a `ChannelOptions` type which contains `params`, `modes` and `cipherParams`, we would send a Map containing these 3 keys, and their values contain the data. The receiving side can immediately get the `modes` from the dictionary.

In the future, this serialization code can be [significantly simplified using Pigeon](https://github.com/ably/ably-flutter/issues/28), but as we could also work on implementing the features in pure Dart SDK and avoid serialization altogether, this work has not yet been started.

In cases where instances cannot be fully serialized between Dart and the platform, we instead store these instances and pass a handle instead. For example, a Realtime client is stored in a Map on the Platform side (e.g. `AblyClientStore.java`), and a handle is passed to the Dart side.
  
### Updating serialization

You'll need to re-generate the platform constants whenever you:
- Change the serialization: 
    - A new codec type - required when a new top level serializable object is required (ex: `ErrorInfo` and `ClientOptions`)
    - Platform and event names - when implementing a new method in `MethodChannel` or new event in `EventChannel`
    - A new type needs to be serialized (either top-level, or nested)
- Change the templates: To change the structure of files being generated, you can modify the templates:
    - `lib/src/generated/platformconstants.dart` for use in Flutter/Dart
    - `android/src/main/java/io/ably/flutter/plugin/generated/PlatformConstants.java` for use in Android/Java
    - `ios/Classes/codec/AblyPlatformConstants.h` for use in iOS/Objective-C
    - `ios/Classes/codec/AblyPlatformConstants.m` for use in iOS/Objective-C

- To add or modify existing platform constants, modify: `codegen_context.dart`
- Then, to regenerate the platform constants using the latest "context", run `cd bin` and `dart codegen.dart`
- Once you have updated these constants, you have to now use these in the implementation.

### Implementing new codec types

1. Add new type along with value in `_types` list at [bin/codegen_context.dart](bin/codegen_context.dart)
2. Add an object definition  with object name and its properties to `objects` list at [bin/codegen_context.dart](bin/codegen_context.dart)
 This will create `Tx<ObjectName>` under which all properties are accessible.
 
Generate platform constants and continue

3. update `getCodecType` in [Codec.dart](lib/src/platform/src/codec.dart) so new codec type is returned based on runtime type
4. update `codecPair` in [Codec.dart](lib/src/platform/src/codec.dart)  so new encoder/decoder is assigned for new type
5. update `writeValue` in [android.src.main.java.io.ably.flutter.plugin.AblyMessageCodec](android/src/main/java/io/ably/flutter/plugin/AblyMessageCodec.java)
 so new codec type is obtained from runtime type
6. update `codecMap` in [android.src.main.java.io.ably.flutter.plugin.AblyMessageCodec](android/src/main/java/io/ably/flutter/plugin/AblyMessageCodec.java)
 so new encoder/decoder is assigned for new type
7. add new codec encoder method in [ios.Classes.codec.AblyFlutterWriter](ios/Classes/codec/AblyFlutterWriter.m)
 and update `getType` and `getEncoder` so that new codec encoder is called
8. add new codec encoder method in [ios.classes.codec.AblyFlutterReader](ios/Classes/codec/AblyFlutterReader.m)
 and update `getDecoder` so that new codec decoder is called

### Implementing new platform methods

1. Add new method name in `_platformMethods` list at [bin/codegen_context.dart](bin/codegen_context.dart)

Generate platform constants and use wherever required

## Static plugin code analyzer

The new flutter analyzer does a great job at analyzing complete flutter package.

Running `flutter analyze` in project root will analyze dart files in complete project,
i.e., plugin code and example code


Or, use the good old dart analyzer

```bash
dartanalyzer --fatal-warnings lib/**/*.dart
dartanalyzer --fatal-warnings example/lib/**/*.dart
```

## dartdoc

### Tool Installation

With just the Flutter tools installed, the following is observed:

```
ably-flutter % which dartdoc
dartdoc not found

?1 ably-flutter % which flutter
/Users/quintinwillison/flutter/bin/flutter
```

The `dartdoc` tool can be activated via the `flutter` command like this:

```
ably-flutter % flutter pub global activate dartdoc
Resolving dependencies...
Downloading...
Precompiling executables...
Precompiled dartdoc:dartdoc.
Installed executable dartdoc.
Warning: Pub installs executables into $HOME/flutter/.pub-cache/bin, which is not on your path.
You can fix that by adding this to your shell's config file (.bashrc, .bash_profile, etc.):

  export PATH="$PATH":"$HOME/flutter/.pub-cache/bin"

Activated dartdoc 0.39.0.
```

And, indeed, on inspecting my path I could confirm that it wasn't present:

```
ably-flutter % echo $PATH
/Users/quintinwillison/.asdf/shims:/Users/quintinwillison/.asdf/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin:/usr/local/share/dotnet:~/.dotnet/tools:/Library/Apple/usr/bin:/Users/quintinwillison/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:/Users/quintinwillison/flutter/bin
```

So I edited my configuration to add the `PATH` export suggested:

```
ably-flutter % vi ~/.zshrc
ably-flutter % source ~/.zshrc
ably-flutter % echo $PATH
/Users/quintinwillison/.asdf/shims:/Users/quintinwillison/.asdf/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin:/usr/local/share/dotnet:~/.dotnet/tools:/Library/Apple/usr/bin:/Users/quintinwillison/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:/Users/quintinwillison/flutter/bin:/Users/quintinwillison/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:/Users/quintinwillison/flutter/bin:/Users/quintinwillison/flutter/.pub-cache/bin
```

And I was then able to find the `dartdoc` tool:

```
ably-flutter % which dartdoc
/Users/quintinwillison/flutter/.pub-cache/bin/dartdoc
```

And see that it had been installed globally in the Flutter context:

```
ably-flutter % flutter pub global list
dartdoc 0.39.0
```

## Release Process

Releases should always be made through a release pull request (PR), which needs to bump the version number and add to the [change log](CHANGELOG.md).
For an example of a previous release PR, see [#89](https://github.com/ably/ably-flutter/pull/89).

The release process must include the following steps:

1. Ensure that all work intended for this release has landed to `main`
2. Create a release branch named like `release/1.2.3`
3. Add a commit to bump the version number
   - Update the version in `pubspec.yaml`
   - Update the version of ably-flutter used in the example app and test integration app `podfile.lock` files:
   - Run `pod install` in `example/ios` and `test_integration/ios`, or run `pod install --project-directory=example/ios` and `pod install --project-directory=test_integration/ios
   - Commit this
4. Add a commit to update the change log. 
  - Autogenerate the changelog contents by running `github_changelog_generator -u ably -p ably-flutter --since-tag 1.2.0 --output delta.md` and manually copying the relevant contents from `delta.md` into `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Make sure to replace `HEAD` in the autogenerated URL's with the version tag you will create (e.g. `v1.2.1`).
5. Check that everything is looking sensible to the Flutter tools without publishing by running: `flutter pub publish --dry-run`
6. Push the release branch to GitHub
7. Open a PR for the release against the release branch you just pushed
8. Gain approval(s) for the release PR from maintainer(s)
9. Land the release PR to `main`
10. Execute `flutter pub publish` from the root of this repository
11. Create a tag named like `v1.2.3`, using `git tag v1.2.3`
12. Push the newly created tag to GitHub: `git push origin v1.2.3`
13. Create a release on GitHub following the [previous releases]((https://github.com/ably/ably-flutter/releases)) as examples.

We tend to use [github_changelog_generator](https://github.com/skywinder/Github-Changelog-Generator) to collate the information required for a change log update.
Your mileage may vary, but it seems the most reliable method to invoke the generator is something like:
`github_changelog_generator -u ably -p ably-flutter --since-tag v1.2.0 --output delta.md`
and then manually merge the delta contents in to the main change log (where `v1.2.0` in this case is the tag for the previous release).
